# Classifying-IMDB-Reviews-Using-PyTorch-and-torchtext
In thie repo, we try to classify reviews from IMDB dataset (imported from torchtext).
Three models are used for the classifier, they are naive lineaer classsifier, 1d CNN and LSTM.
Pretrained Glove or random intialized embedding are used as representations of words.
